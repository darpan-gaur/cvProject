\section{Observations}
\label{sec:observations}

We have shown some few examples of the output from our SimCLR plus RELAX pipeline showing the most important parts of the image and also the certainty with which this importance is proposed. The high importance areas are highlighted as masking those key areas of the images changes the representation of the image by a large margin. We can see the model noting the main object from the images being the ship, airplane and the bird with high certainty. For future works we'd like to compare the explainability of this pipeline with other explainable self supervised models.
