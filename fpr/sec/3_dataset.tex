\section{Dataset}
\label{sec:dataset}

Since our objective is to obtain explainable representations using self-supervised learning, we are not restricted to a specific dataset. Instead, we aim to experiment with datasets that provide diverse visual concepts, enabling a better evaluation of both representation learning and explainability. For this purpose, currently we have considered the CIFAR-10 dataset for simplicity. For further works, we may shift to a dataset with more variety so that we can evaluate how well the model is able to explain various class representations.
