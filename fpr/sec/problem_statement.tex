\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem_statement}

Our project aims to bridge the gap between self-supervised learning and explainable AI by investigating how to interpret SSL-learned representations. Specifically, we will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Train an SSL model using contrastive learning (e.g., SimCLR\cite{chen2020simple}, MoCo\cite{he2020momentum}) and SwAV \cite{caron2020unsupervised}.
    \item Apply Grad-CAM\cite{selvaraju2017grad} and RELAX\cite{wickstrom2023relax},  explainability techniques to visualize the important regions in SSL feature maps.
    \item Explore perceptual components based \cite{yarici2024explaining} explainability techniques to align SSL representations with human-interpretable concepts.
    \item Investigate the impact of different SSL architectures on explainability.
\end{itemize}
