Things to do:
- Implement [EXPLAINING REPRESENTATION LEARNING WITH PERCEPTUAL COMPONENTS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10647891), similar to relax, adds color importance, shape importance and texture importance. [GitHub Link](https://github.com/olivesgatech/Explaining-Representation-Learning-with-Perceptual-Components)
- Train 2 more self-supervised representation learning models and compare the results.
    - SwAW
    - Berlow twins
    - VicREG
- Used gradient based methods on supervised models and compare the results.
    - Grad-CAM
    - Opti-CAM
