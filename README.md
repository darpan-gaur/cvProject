## Models
For models and data, please refer to the [OneDrive Folder](https://iith-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/co21btech11004_iith_ac_in/EiKuBfu8qvlKiWGDwPKSBkgBJW6jVpuKbjhJ0CVPd0BUzQ?e=rz7wuu)

- checkpoint_0200.pth.tar download and put in cvProject/src/SimCLR/runs/Mar25_10-54-39_node3
- checkpoint_1000.pth.tar download and put in cvProject/src/SimCLR/runs/Mar25_11-51-42_node3

In the src directory experiments folder containes code for all the experiments.
