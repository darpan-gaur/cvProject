\section{Dataset}
\label{sec:dataset}

Since our objective is to obtain explainable representations using self-supervised learning, we are not restricted to a specific dataset. Instead, we aim to experiment with datasets that provide diverse visual concepts, enabling a better evaluation of both representation learning and explainability. For this purpose, we consider using either the CIFAR-10 or ImageNet datasets. The choice of dataset will depend on the computational constraints and the level of detail required for explainability analysis.
