\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem_statement}

Our project aims to bridge the gap between self-supervised learning and explainable AI by investigating how to interpret SSL-learned representations. Specifically, we will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pre-train an SSL model using contrastive learning (e.g., SimCLR\cite{chen2020simple} or MoCo).
    \item Apply Grad-CAM\cite{Selvaraju_2017_ICCV}, RELAX\cite{wickstr√∏m2022relaxrepresentationlearningexplainability} or other explainability techniques to visualize the important regions in SSL feature maps.
    \item Explore concept-based explainability techniques (e.g., TCAV, ProtoPNet) to align SSL representations with human-interpretable concepts.
    \item Evaluate the trade-off between interpretability and performance.
\end{itemize}
